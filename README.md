# GPU builds of TensorFlow 1.2+ for Mac 
Since the release of TensorFlow 1.2, Google dropped the support of GPU builds of TensorFlow. This repo is meant to give built version of TensorFlow ready to use with a simple pip install.

I'm testing the builds on my MacBookPro Mid 2014 with a GT750M. 

# Installation
Just download the corresponding wheel and use the following command:
```bash
pip3 install tensorflow-1.2.0rc0-cp35-cp35m-macosx_10_12_x86_64.whl
```

# Worth Noting
I'm using Python 3.5 so no build for Python 2.7 for now.
